## Skills

#### Communication
I pride myself in having the skills to build a strong rapport with the people that I interact with, due to my background in healthcare. Effective verbal and written communication skills are integral in client satisfaction, successful collaborative teams and for professional development. Furthermore, communication skills are critical in maintaining harmonious working relationships in a fast-paced environment. I am also aware of the importance of being an active and empathic listener, in order to be an excellent communicator. 
My understanding of this has been very beneficial during Makers, since it enabled me to build rapport with other members of my engineering team, whilst working under pressure to meet project deadlines.

#### Aptitude for Learning
I have always been open and curious in learning new things and new experiences, as I aim to continuously grow and develop as an individual. From experience, for example: when a manager or colleague assigned me a task with brief instructions, I am perceptive in understanding the steps that I need to execute, to complete that task effectively and efficiently. I believe that learning new things helps to enhance one's quality of life, as it can increase self-confidence, is empowering and facilitates self-discovery by encouraging one to step outside of their comfort zone. 

#### Critical Thinker
One key aspect of working as a software engineer that I love, is: problem solving. My background in healthcare helped me to develop the skills that I need to be capable of being assertive and delivering solutions to problems. I have found coding to help improve my logical reasoning and decision making abilities.

#### Perseverance and Resilience
When faced with a challenging obstacle, I am the type of person that will commit to spending the time necessary to break it down. When a task seems impossible at first, I do not give up because I believe that if you set your mind on something, you will always be able to achieve it. I think that an essential factor in perseverance and resilience, is knowing how important it is to ask for help when you need it. Delaying asking for help can be counterproductive and an ineffective use of time.

#### Diversity and Inclusion
Having worked as a midwife in London, I have had rich exposure in working with people from a diverse and multicultural demographic. My positive, compassionate and kind disposition means that I can connect with people from diverse backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders and religions, I embrace diversity. I recognise the importance of each individual's rights and I am always respectful and polite.
